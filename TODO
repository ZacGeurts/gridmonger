BUGS
====

- selecting single line text selects whole line

- trail mode in combination with undo/redo acts a bit weird (enable trail
  mode, move a few steps, disable trail mode, move a few steps, repeat a few
  times, then undo back to the beginning)

- floor type doors are slightly off-center


TODO
====

  - add unlink command
  - prefill level with empty floor (for wall style maps)

  - finish diagonal movement (numpad, YUBN)
  - improve restoring the window's size on screen dimension changes
  - test layout save/restore on multi-monitor setup
  - test restore last layout on multi-monitor setup
  - test loading v1.1.0 configs, themes and maps

  - window handling bugs:
    - crash when dragging maximised window

  - test extensively & update manual
