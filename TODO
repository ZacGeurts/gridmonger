BUGS
====

- trail mode in combination with undo/redo acts a bit weird (enable trail
  mode, move a few steps, disable trail mode, move a few steps, repeat a few
  times, then undo back to the beginning)

- notes pane should fill the window horizontally when the tools pane is hidden

- move copies labels instead of moving then cell is empty

- move selection severs links (but nudge works)

- warning when closing new map that was never manually saved

- selecting single line text selects whole line

- clear floor should not remove comments?



TODO
====

  - diagonal movement with numpad
  - test extensively & update manual

  - generate app shortcuts at runtime based on some flags (e.g.
	yubnMovementKeys). this simplifies generating the quickrefs & the key
	handling, and allows to switch between Ctrl/Cmd on macOS

  - option to use Cmd key on macOS (selectable at runtime)

  - list all notes pane on the left:
    - filter by note type (none, number, ID, icon -- each category can be toggled)
    - show all notes, or only for the current level
	- sort by level elevation or note name

  - clipping indicator when nudging / moving

  - window handling bugs:
	  - crash when dragging maximised window

  - add support for wraparound to move & paste preview mode

  - OS X:
    - gridmonger document icon
