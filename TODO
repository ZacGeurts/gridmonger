BUGS
====

- warning when closing new map that was never manually saved

- selecting single line text selects whole line

- trail mode in combination with undo/redo acts a bit weird (enable trail
  mode, move a few steps, disable trail mode, move a few steps, repeat a few
  times, then undo back to the beginning)


TODO
====

  - test loading v1, v2, and v3 map versions
  - fix invalid map links on-the-fly

  - finish diagonal movement (numpad, YUBN)
  - improve restoring the window's size on screen dimension changes

  - window handling bugs:
    - crash when dragging maximised window

  - autosave does not save new map that hasn't been saved before

  - if a new map has been autosaved but never saved manually, quitting would
	proceed without a warning and the map will be lost

  - test extensively & update manual
